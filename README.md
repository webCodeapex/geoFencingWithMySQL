A very basic geoFencing project is here. 

It provides you the functionality to draw a polygon shape on the google map. You can search your region by entering your area's latitude and longitude and can draw geoFencing around any of your favorite places. Then on the completion of polygon shape, it asks you if you want to save that shape coordinates to the database or wanted to reDraw the shape.

Show all the saved regions over google map colored with different colors, search for a particular point and detect if a clicked point lies inside any of the polygon regions.
