A very basic geoFencing project is here. 

let you search your region by entering your area latitude and longitude.
It provides you the functionality to draw a polygon shape on the google map. Then on the completion of polygon shape ask you if you want to save that shape coordinates to the database or not.

Show all the saved regions over google map colored with different colors, search for a particular point and detect if a clicked point lies inside any of the polygon regions.
